# Prova Finale di Reti Logiche AA 2020-2021
The goal of the project is the implementation of a hardware component, in VHDL, capable of recalibrating the contrast of the images. The recalibation of an image is realized through the equalization algorithm and the maximum dimension allowed for input images is 128 x 128 pixels.
